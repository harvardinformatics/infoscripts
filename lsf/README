Prerequisites
=============

You need the lsf libraries and the mysql development tools.

To Build
========

cd src

make

The Setup
=========

Create your database 

  echo "create database lsf " |mysql -u lsfuser -pxxxxxx 

Load the sql

  mysql -u lsfuser -pxxxxxx lsf < sql/finish_job.sql
  mysql -u lsfuser -pxxxxxx lsf < sql/user.sql

Configure your mysql instance to have oodles of memory - the max for key_buffer_size.

The Programs
============

1. bin/update_users <userfile>

Loads users and groups from a file and saves them to the db

Userfile has a username and group on one line separated by spaces.

e.g.

mclamp  rc_admin
mclamp  solexa_users

A user can be in more than one group.

2. bin/import_lsf_log <lsb.acct file>

Reads events from an lsf lsb.acct file (Ours are found in /lsf/work/odyssey-lsf/logdir) and saves to the db.

The program checks the first and last record in the file to see whether it has already loaded it.

If a user isn't in the database it will be created (without a group).
