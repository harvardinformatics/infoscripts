Prerequisites
=============

You need the lsf libraries and the mysql development tools.


The Setup
=========

Create your database 

  echo "create database lsf " |mysql -u lsfuser -pxxxxxx 

Load the sql

  mysql -u lsfuser -pxxxxxx lsf < sql/finish_job.sql
  mysql -u lsfuser -pxxxxxx lsf < sql/user.sql

Configure your mysql instance to have oodles of memory - the max for key_buffer_size.

To Build
========

cd src

Edit mysql.c to set the mysql dbname,user etc.

make

cd ../

The binaries are in the bin directory

The Programs
============

1. bin/update_users <userfile>

Loads users and groups from a file and saves them to the db

Userfile has a username and group on one line separated by spaces.

e.g.

mclamp  rc_admin
mclamp  solexa_users

A user can be in more than one group.

2. bin/import_lsf_log <lsb.acct file>

Reads events from an lsf lsb.acct file (Ours are found in /lsf/work/odyssey-lsf/logdir) and saves to the db.

The program checks the first and last record in the file to see whether it has already loaded it.

If a user isn't in the database it will be created (without a group).

The Web Pages
=============

cd www

Edit lsf_query.php, username_query.php and labgroup_query.php to set the right mysql params (yes I know they should be central)

link the contents of the www under your apache document root

e.g.

cd /var/www/html

ln -s /home/mclamp/lsf/www lsf

The main url is lsf_chart.php
